Projects done for the course ENEE439M

Bayes and KNN Classifier are built from scratch for face recognition. 
They make use of PCA and LDA to reduce dimensionality. 

SVM and CNN are implemented using scikit-learn and Keras. 
It is implemented on MNIST data.
SVM and SVM Kernel both are implemented.
